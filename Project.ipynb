    "I have chosen to use Google Cloud SQL with PostgreSQL as the datastore. This decision is based primarily on the structured nature of the Reddit RSS feed data, which includes well-defined fields like title, author, subreddit, created_at, and content. SQL databases are designed to handle structured data with predefined schemas, that makes it ideal for maintaining data integrity and enabling complex queries. The ability to enforce schema validation ensures the accuracy and consistency of the data stored, reducing the risk of errors during analysis. Furthermore, SQL’s powerful querying capabilities are well-suited for tasks such as aggregations, filtering, and analyzing data trends, which are central to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Cloud SQL integrates seamlessly with other GCP services, supporting scalability, automated backups, and high availability. Its ability to scale makes it an excellent choice for handling increasing amounts of data as the project grows. In contrast to NoSQL solutions like Firestore, which are more suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, SQL databases provide stronger support for analytical tasks and complex relationships. Additionally, the widespread adoption of SQL ensures familiarity, accessibility, and ease of collaboration among team members. This choice ensures the project has a reliable, efficient, and future-proof system for storing and analyzing Reddit RSS feed data."

I’m more concerned about being able to bury/cremate them without going into debt or using my personal savings. They on the other hand want a lump sum of money to be left behind to us kids and grand kids. They were looking into $100k - $200k policies.  I know health and age have an effect on policy prices. They constantly get offers from AAA for decent priced policies and they only ask 3 basic health questions, which none seem to pertain to their specific issues. Is this a safe option? I’m just super lost as with AAA it looks like the rate increases every few years and then completely cut off at 80. I don’t know nor think my parents will live to 80 (I would absolutely love if they did but not too common in either family) so does that mean once they hit 81 all that money I paid is just done and gone? And how on earth would a I find a new policy for them later on as I’m sure it’s very expensive to insure someone at that age. Also what if they do pass during the policy then for some reason their death benefits are denied due to them having existing conditions? I have no intention to lie on their application but if AAA isn’t asking what do I do? They mainly ask about nicotine use, major issues like cancer, and undiagnosed conditions.

She met his parents a week after, he met hers later and he even bought a shit expensive gift for her on vacation.  Anyways my point is I am so disappointed and sad like why was she a cheating, lying gf the whole two years with me and was “just being friendly” with other guys and suddenly she doesn’t even go out anymore. No commitment issues and literally told me she is happier than ever when she was miserable the whole 2 years with me and the only reasons she would text me was to talk about her being miserable at her summer job or complain about university professors.

      "Title: Retiring early - advice on options in addition to defined benefit pension\n",
      "Summary: I'm looking for advice on the best means to facilitate early(ish) retirement.  I'm a civil servant and a member of the alpha civil service pension scheme, so I accrue 2.32% of my pensionable earning per year towards an entitlement. My normal pension age is 68, and if I claim my normal alpha pension before then it takes quite a significant actuarial reduction to account for me claiming it for longer. I'm on track to have a reasonable normal alpha pension. However, I would quite like to retire before I'm 68.  My defined pension offers one potential solution, an Early Pension Age (EPA). The 3 year EPA (which is the most years they offer) would cost me 4.1% of my pensionable earnings per month (which I think would be about £188) and I would accumulate a seperate entitlement of 2.32% of my pensionable earnings. My understanding is that this entitlement would only last for 3 years, and is designed to bridge the gap between retiring at 65 and claiming my normal alpha pension at 68. If I go down this route, my EPA-3 entitlement would be a bit less than my normal alpha entitlement (due to starting contributions later), but would still be enough for those 3 years. I would also be contributing to my normal alpha pension for 3 fewer years (due to retiring at 65), but again that normal entitlement would still be enough. One of the main downsides is I would still have to wait to 65 to retire. My preference would be to retire a few years earlier, though I'm conscious of losing too many years contributing to my normal pension entitlement as well.  I'm vaguely aware of other options, like SIPPs, which I've mostly read about in this sub. I don't know too much about this though. My main concerns are how to account for inflation and the long-term confidence in SIPP growth rate. With the civil service pension, my entitlement is uprated automatically, so I don't need to worry about that at least.  If I put the £188 I would be contributing to my EPA-3 into a SIPP instead, would it create a larger pot than the equivalent my 3 year EPA entitlement? Would kind of growth rate is common in SIPPs? How much growth rate is needed to account for inflation and to offset any fees associated with managing a SIPP?  I'm also seeking formal financial advice, but would appreciate any insights from here as well.  /u/GlobularClusters r/UKPersonalFinance [link] [comments]\n",

      "Body: i'm the manager of a locally owned charity shop. i'm there 5 out of the 6 days we are open. over the past month or so, i've noticed an older model Cadillac escalade pulling up next to the storage containers about 15 feet behind our building. they park, sit with the car running for about half an hour, then drive off or sometimes they shut the car off and sit there for literal hours. i've never seen them leave the car. they park with the rear facing our back door; this might be strategic, since their back windows are so tinted you can't see in. from where they park, they'd be able to clearly watch employees accepting donations, going back and forth to the containers, and taking out the trash.  this has increased in frequency since i first noticed it, and now it's almost a daily occurrence. today, i timed them - they were just sitting there in the vehicle for over two hours. my one coworker - who i'm rarely scheduled with - noticed that i kept checking our back door, so i told her about it. she apparently had never noticed the vehicle and sort of dismissed it with an \"oh well, maybe they're sleeping.\" i've brought this up with my assistant manager before, and she agrees that the behavior is shady. so far, we haven’t escalated anything other than writing down the license plate number.  we've had issues in years past (before i started working there) with people going through the dumpsters, but now it only happens about once a month. i don't think this person is going through the trash. unfortunately, there is someone from a job that i left a year ago who was acting a bit predatory, but i don't think he'd find out where i work now as i don't post life updates on social media or anything. i've also been a victim of harassment and hate crimes, living as a visibly alternative person in a small conservative town, so this is putting me on edge. our security cameras are down and it will likely be into january when we can finally get it fixed. if something happens, there's nothing we can really do.  i don't know. i'm not sure if i'm overreacting here, thinking that we are being stalked. the whole thing just seems very suspicious, and i can't think of an explanation as to why somebody would park there for so long on a near-daily basis. opinions?? :/  /u/stxrbxzz r/AmIOverreacting [link] [comments]\n",

The wide temperature differences in the terraces have created microclimates, similar to what is achieved in greenhouses in modern times. The landmark also looks similar to an open pit mine. After the mining was done, the Incas could have reinforced the walls to prevent landslides and started to grow crops on the terraces.  submitted by /u/Any-Reply343 to r/PrecolumbianEra   [link]  [comments] \n",

      "Body: My parents are in their mid 50s have no insurance lined up. I have to work with them on this but I have no idea where to start. They don’t own any real estate or investments. One has a paid off car the other does not. Both have health issues then I don’t know the specifics on, but I know their nightstands are full of meds. I know for sure one is diabetic. They both likely have some form of debt but nothing major.  I’m more concerned about being able to bury/cremate them without going into debt or using my personal savings. They on the other hand want a lump sum of money to be left behind to us kids and grand kids. They were looking into $100k - $200k policies.  I know health and age have an effect on policy prices. They constantly get offers from AAA for decent priced policies and they only ask 3 basic health questions, which none seem to pertain to their specific issues. Is this a safe option? I’m just super lost as with AAA it looks like the rate increases every few years and then completely cut off at 80. I don’t know nor think my parents will live to 80 (I would absolutely love if they did but not too common in either family) so does that mean once they hit 81 all that money I paid is just done and gone? And how on earth would a I find a new policy for them later on as I’m sure it’s very expensive to insure someone at that age. Also what if they do pass during the policy then for some reason their death benefits are denied due to them having existing conditions? I have no intention to lie on their application but if AAA isn’t asking what do I do? They mainly ask about nicotine use, major issues like cancer, and undiagnosed conditions. Also should I let them get their own policies and just pay it from my account or should I take out policies on them?  /u/curiousaf_tm r/LifeInsurance [link] [comments]\n",

    "The tabular data provides a detailed breakdown of sentiment polarity and subjectivity scores, along with word frequency analysis. The sentiment polarity mean (0.038) suggests that most of the text leans toward neutrality, with minimal positive or negative sentiment. The range of polarity scores, spanning from -0.3 to 1.0, indicates that while most of the data remains neutral, there are occasional spikes of strong positive and negative emotions. Subjectivity, with a mean of 0.271, highlights that the text is largely factual and objective, though it does include some degree of personal opinions or subjective elements. This is further reinforced by the data's standard deviation, which demonstrates variability in tone and emotion across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word frequency analysis reveals that the most common terms are general stop words like \"and,\" \"I,\" and \"a,\" which reflect the structure of natural language. Words like \"my\" suggest that the content often includes personal narratives or anecdotal details. These results align with the neutral sentiment findings, emphasizing factual content interspersed with subjective and interactive elements typical of user-generated platforms like Reddit."

    "The sentiment distribution box plot shows that neutral sentiment is the most prevalent among the analyzed posts, as indicated by its larger range and higher median. Positive sentiment exhibits a narrower distribution and consistently higher median values, suggesting a notable presence of positivity in the data. Negative sentiment, on the other hand, has a smaller range and lower values overall, with only a few extreme outliers. This visual insight aligns with the tabular data, reinforcing the understanding that the majority of the content is neutral, with positive tones occasionally surfacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word frequency bar chart showcases the dominance of common stop words and platform-specific terms, indicating the interactive nature of Reddit. Words like \"to\" and \"the\" dominate, but their prevalence underlines the structural aspects of language used in the summaries. Additionally, the inclusion of \"my\" in the top words supports the notion of personal engagement, as users often share their experiences or thoughts. These insights illustrate a dataset that is neutral in tone, factual in nature, and occasionally personal or interactive, consistent with the characteristics of user-generated content."
