      "\n",
      "Product analytics and data scientist interviews at tech companies often include an A/B testing component. Here is my framework on how to answer A/B testing interview questions. Please note that this is not necessarily a guide to design a good A/B test. Rather, it is a guide to help you convince an interviewer that you know how to design A/B tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A/B Test Interview Framework**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine during the interview that you get asked “Walk me through how you would A/B test this new feature?”. This framework will help you pass these types of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Set the context for the experiment. Why do we want to AB test, what is our goal, what do we want to measure?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first step is to clarify the purpose and value of the experiment with the interviewer. Is it even worth running an A/B test? Interviewers want to know that the candidate can tie experiments to business goals.\n",
      "2. Specify what exactly is the treatment, and what hypothesis are we testing? Too often I see candidates fail to specify what the treatment is, and what is the hypothesis that they want to test. It’s important to spell this out for your interviewer. \n",
      "3. After specifying the treatment and the hypothesis, you need to define the metrics that you will track and measure.\n",
      "   * Success metrics: Identify at least 2-3 candidate success metrics. Then narrow it down to one and propose it to the interviewer to get their thoughts.\n",
      "   * Guardrail metrics: Guardrail metrics are metrics that you do not want to harm. You don’t necessarily want to improve them, but you definitely don’t want to harm them. Come up with 2-4 of these.\n",
      "   * Tracking metrics: Tracking metrics help explain the movement in the success metrics. Come up with 1-4 of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: How do we design the experiment to measure what we want to measure?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Now that you have your treatment, hypothesis, and metrics, the next step is to determine the unit of randomization for the experiment, and when each unit will enter the experiment. You should pick a unit of randomization such that you can measure success your metrics, avoid interference and network effects, and consider user experience.\n",
      "   * As a simple example, let’s say you want to test a treatment that changes the color of the checkout button on an ecommerce website from blue to green. How would you randomize this? You could randomize at the user level and say that every person that visits your website will be randomized into the treatment or control group. Another way would be to randomize at the session level, or even at the checkout page level. \n",
      "   * When each unit will enter the experiment is also important. Using the example above, you could have a person enter the experiment as soon as they visit the website. However, many users will not get all the way to the checkout page so you will end up with a lot of users who never even got a chance to see your treatment, which will dilute your experiment. In this case, it might make sense to have a person enter the experiment once they reach the checkout page. You want to choose your unit of randomization and when they will enter the experiment such that you have minimal dilution. In a perfect world, every unit would have the chance to be exposed to your treatment.\n",
      "2. The next step is to conduct a power analysis to determine the number of observations required and how long to run the experiment. You can either state that you would conduct a power analysis using an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, or ask the interviewer of the company has standards you should use.\n",
      "   * I’m not going to go into how to calculate power here, but know that in any AB  test interview question, you will have to mention power. For some companies, and in junior roles, just mentioning this will be good enough. Other companies, especially for more senior roles, might ask you more specifics about how to calculate power. \n",
      "3. Next, you need to determine which statistical test(s) you will use to analyze the results. Is a simple t-test sufficient, or do you need quasi-experimental techniques like difference in differences? Do you require heteroskedastic robust standard errors or clustered standard errors?\n",
      "   * The t-test and z-test of proportions are two of the most common tests.\n",
      "   * If your unit of randomization is larger than your analysis unit, you may need to adjust how you calculate your standard errors.\n",
      "   * You might be thinking “why would I need to use difference-in-difference in an AB test”? In my experience, this is common when doing a geography based randomization on a relatively small sample size. Let’s say that you want to randomize by city in the state of California. It’s likely that even though you are randomizing which cities are in the treatment and control groups, that your two groups will have pre-existing biases. A common solution is to use difference-in-difference. I’m not saying this is right or wrong, but it’s a common solution that I have seen in tech companies.\n",
      "4. Final considerations for the experiment design: \n",
      "   * Are you testing multiple metrics? If so, account for that in your analysis. A really common academic answer is the Bonferonni correction. I've never seen anyone use it in real life though, because it is too conservative. A more common way is to control the False Discovery Rate. You can google this. Alternatively, the book [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://amzn.to/4dzXyZP) by Ron Kohavi discusses how to do this (note: this is an affiliate link). \n",
      "   * Do any stakeholders need to be informed about the experiment? \n",
      "   * Are there any novelty effects or change aversion that could impact interpretation?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3:** **The experiment is over. Now what?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. After you “run” the A/B test, you now have some data. Consider what recommendations you can make from them. What insights can you derive to take actionable steps for the business? Speaking to this will earn you brownie points with the interviewer.\n",
      "   * For example, can you think of some useful ways to segment your experiment data to determine whether there were heterogeneous treatment effects?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common follow-up questions, or “gotchas”**\n",
      "\n",
      "These are common questions that interviewers will ask to see if you really understand A/B testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Let’s say that you are mid-way through running your A/B test and the performance starts to get worse. It had a strong start but now your success metric is degrading. Why do you think this could be?\n",
      "   * A common answer is novelty effect\n",
      "* Let’s say that your AB test is concluded and your chosen p-value cutoff is 0.05. However, your success metric has a p-value of 0.06. What do you do?\n",
      "   * Some options are: Extend the experiment. Run the experiment again.\n",
      "   * You can also say that you would discuss the risk of a false positive with your business stakeholders. It may be that the treatment doesn’t have much downside, so the company is OK with rolling out the feature, even if there is no true improvement. However, this is a discussion that needs to be had with all relevant stakeholders and as a data scientist or product analyst, you need to help quantify the risk of rolling out a false positive treatment.\n",
      "* Your success metric was stat sig positive, but one of your guardrail metrics was harmed. What do you do?\n",
      "   * Investigate the cause of the guardrail metric dropping. Once the cause is identified, work with the product manager or business stakeholders to update the treatment such that hopefully the guardrail will not be harmed, and run the experiment again.\n",
      "   * Alternatively, see if there is a segment of the population where the guardrail metric was not harmed. Release the treatment to only this population segment.\n",
      "* Your success metric ended up being stat sig negative. How would you diagnose this? \n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is really long but honestly, most of the steps I listed could be an entire blog post by itself. If you don't understand anything, I encourage you to do some more research about it, or get the book that I linked above (I've read it 3 times through myself). Lastly, don't feel like you need to be an A/B test expert to pass the interview. We hire folks who have no A/B testing experience but can demonstrate framework of designing AB tests such as the one I have just laid out. Good luck!\n",

The schemas in the source and target systems are different and there are some other complicating factors, so the whole project is quite intricate.

Their code is also very difficult to follow. The other issue is that a lot of the details of the migration only exist in T1's head. Their justification for this or that is often \"well I had a conversation with this engineer about it.\" So it's hard to ascertain the reasoning behind many parts of the script, which then makes it impossible to finish it.

When part of the script needs to be changed, T1 copies that part out into a Google Doc interspersed with instructions (the instructions aren't code or comments). Then T1 reviews the Google Docs, tests the code from them, copies chunk by chunk around the instructions, and pastes them back into the Google Sheet. T1 was having us follow this method to finish the script.\n",

      "I think this approach is absolutely nuts. It's not reasonable to have 4 people working on a program without some form of version control in place, and Google Docs/Sheets are not good places for writing code. I copied the code from the Sheet into a GitHub repo and added T2 and T3 to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I reached out to T1 and explained my position. T1 asked to talk to T2 and I on the phone. T1's view is that source control isn't appropriate for creating new code, only for maintaining existing code, and that it would only slow us down. \"I know what source control is. Check in, check out... yeah that's going to take forever.\"\n",

      "1. they turn the project into a chat bot\n",
      "2. they use an LLM for some key feature in a larger application, resulting in an error prone mess\n",
      "\n",
      "there's tremendous power in using LLMs to power specific features within larger applications, but LLMs inconsistency in output structure makes it difficult to use their output within a programmatic system. You might ask an llm to output JSON data, for instance, and the LLM decides it's appropriate to wrap the data in a `\\`\\`\\`json \\`\\`\\`` markdown format. you might ask an LLM to output a list of values, and it responds with something like this:\n",

[LangChain's pydantic parser](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/output_parser_structured/) allows one to define an object which is either constructed from the LLMs output, or an error gets thrown. They essentially use a clever prompting system paired with the user's defined structure to coax the model into a consistent output.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not fool proof either, which is why it's a common practice to either re-try or re-prompt. You can either just re-prompt on a failure, or pass the response which failed to parse to the LLM again and ask the LLM to correct it's mistake. For robust LLMs this works consistently enough where it's actually viable in applications (assuming proper error handling). I made a post about [LangGraph](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1fknbyi/langgraph_allows_you_to_make_falsifiable_testable/) recently, this can also be used to construct complex loops/decisions which can be useful for adding a level of robustness into LLM responses.\n",

      "\n",
      "The idea leverages a quirk of LLMs that's derived from the way they're trained. Most folks know LLMs output text autoregressively, meaning LLMs predict the next word iteratively until they've generated an entire sequence. recurrent strategies like LSTMs also used to output text autoregressively, but they were incredibly slow to train because the model needed to be exposed to a sequence numerous times to learn from that sequence.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "Transformer style LLMs use masked multi-headed self-attention to speed up training significantly by allowing the model to predict every word in a sequence as if future words did not exist. During training an LLM predicts the first, second, third, fourth, and all other tokens in the output sequence as if it were, currently, \"the next token\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Because they're trained doing this \"predict every word as the next word\" thing, they also do it during inference. There are tricks people do to modify this process to gain on efficiency, but generally speaking when an LLM generates a token at inference it also generates all tokens as if future tokens did not exist, we just usually only care about the last one.\n",
      "\n",
      "With speculative sampling/decoding (simultaneously proposed in two different papers, hence two names), you use a small LLM called the \"draft model\" to generate a sequence of a few tokens, then you pass that sequence to a large LLM called the \"target model\". The target model will predict the next token in the sequence but also, because it will predict every next tokens as if future tokens didn't exist, it will also either agree or disagree with the draft model throughout the sequence. You can simply find the first spot where the target model disagrees with the draft model, and keep what the target model predicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "By doing this you can sometimes generate seven or more tokens for every run of the target model. Because the draft model is significantly less expensive and significantly faster, this can allow for significant cost and time savings. Of course, the target model could always disagree with the draft model. If that's the case, the output will be identical to if only the target model was being run. The only difference would be a small cost and time penalty.\n",

I'm not going to get into the distinction between analytics and data science/machine learning here. Just know that I don't do any predictive modeling, and instead do primarily AB testing, causal inference, and dashboarding/reporting. I do want to make one thing clear: This advice is primarily applicable to analytics roles in tech. It is probably not applicable for ML or Applied Scientist roles, or for fields other than tech. Analytics roles can be very lucrative, and the barrier to entry is lower than that for Machine Learning roles.

      "* **You have to be able to pass the SQL screen**. My current company, as well as other large companies such as Meta and Amazon, literally only test SQL as for as technical coding goes. This is pass/fail. You have to pass this. We get so many candidates that look great on paper and all say they are expert in SQL, but can't pass the SQL screen. Grind SQL interview questions until you can answer easy questions in <4 minutes, medium questions in <5 minutes, and hard questions in <7 minutes. This should let you pass 95% of SQL interviews for tech analytics roles.\n",
      "* You will likely be asked some case study type questions. To pass this, you’ll likely need to know AB testing and have strong product sense, and maybe causal inference for senior/principal level roles. [This article by Interviewquery](https://www.interviewquery.com/p/data-science-case-study-interview-questions#data-analytics-case-study-questions) provides a lot of case question examples, although it doesn’t provide sample answers (I have no affiliation with Interviewquery). All of them are relevant for tech analytics role case interviews except the Modeling and Machine Learning section.\n",

      "**Final notes**  \n",
      "It's really that simple (although not easy). In the past 2.5 years, I passed 11 out of 12 SQL screens by grinding 10-20 SQL questions per day for 2 weeks. I also practiced a bunch of product sense case questions, brushed up on my AB testing, and learned common causal inference techniques. As a result, I landed 6 offers out of 8 final round interviews. Please note that my above advice is not necessarily what is needed to be successful in tech analytics. It is advice for how to pass the tech analytics interviews.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm a Sr. Analytics Data Scientist at a large tech firm (not FAANG) and I conduct about \\~3 interviews per week. I wanted to share my advice on how to pass A/B test interview questions as this is an area I commonly see candidates get dinged. Hope it helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Product analytics and data scientist interviews at tech companies often include an A/B testing component. Here is my framework on how to answer A/B testing interview questions. Please note that this is not necessarily a guide to design a good A/B test. Rather, it is a guide to help you convince an interviewer that you know how to design A/B tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**A/B Test Interview Framework**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine during the interview that you get asked “Walk me through how you would A/B test this new feature?”. This framework will help you pass these types of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 1: Set the context for the experiment. Why do we want to AB test, what is our goal, what do we want to measure?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first step is to clarify the purpose and value of the experiment with the interviewer. Is it even worth running an A/B test? Interviewers want to know that the candidate can tie experiments to business goals.\n",
      "2. Specify what exactly is the treatment, and what hypothesis are we testing? Too often I see candidates fail to specify what the treatment is, and what is the hypothesis that they want to test. It’s important to spell this out for your interviewer. \n",
      "3. After specifying the treatment and the hypothesis, you need to define the metrics that you will track and measure.\n",
      "   * Success metrics: Identify at least 2-3 candidate success metrics. Then narrow it down to one and propose it to the interviewer to get their thoughts.\n",
      "   * Guardrail metrics: Guardrail metrics are metrics that you do not want to harm. You don’t necessarily want to improve them, but you definitely don’t want to harm them. Come up with 2-4 of these.\n",
      "   * Tracking metrics: Tracking metrics help explain the movement in the success metrics. Come up with 1-4 of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 2: How do we design the experiment to measure what we want to measure?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Now that you have your treatment, hypothesis, and metrics, the next step is to determine the unit of randomization for the experiment, and when each unit will enter the experiment. You should pick a unit of randomization such that you can measure success your metrics, avoid interference and network effects, and consider user experience.\n",
      "   * As a simple example, let’s say you want to test a treatment that changes the color of the checkout button on an ecommerce website from blue to green. How would you randomize this? You could randomize at the user level and say that every person that visits your website will be randomized into the treatment or control group. Another way would be to randomize at the session level, or even at the checkout page level. \n",
      "   * When each unit will enter the experiment is also important. Using the example above, you could have a person enter the experiment as soon as they visit the website. However, many users will not get all the way to the checkout page so you will end up with a lot of users who never even got a chance to see your treatment, which will dilute your experiment. In this case, it might make sense to have a person enter the experiment once they reach the checkout page. You want to choose your unit of randomization and when they will enter the experiment such that you have minimal dilution. In a perfect world, every unit would have the chance to be exposed to your treatment.\n",
      "2. The next step is to conduct a power analysis to determine the number of observations required and how long to run the experiment. You can either state that you would conduct a power analysis using an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, or ask the interviewer of the company has standards you should use.\n",
      "   * I’m not going to go into how to calculate power here, but know that in any AB  test interview question, you will have to mention power. For some companies, and in junior roles, just mentioning this will be good enough. Other companies, especially for more senior roles, might ask you more specifics about how to calculate power. \n",
      "3. Next, you need to determine which statistical test(s) you will use to analyze the results. Is a simple t-test sufficient, or do you need quasi-experimental techniques like difference in differences? Do you require heteroskedastic robust standard errors or clustered standard errors?\n",
      "   * The t-test and z-test of proportions are two of the most common tests.\n",
      "   * If your unit of randomization is larger than your analysis unit, you may need to adjust how you calculate your standard errors.\n",
      "   * You might be thinking “why would I need to use difference-in-difference in an AB test”? In my experience, this is common when doing a geography based randomization on a relatively small sample size. Let’s say that you want to randomize by city in the state of California. It’s likely that even though you are randomizing which cities are in the treatment and control groups, that your two groups will have pre-existing biases. A common solution is to use difference-in-difference. I’m not saying this is right or wrong, but it’s a common solution that I have seen in tech companies.\n",
      "4. Final considerations for the experiment design: \n",
      "   * Are you testing multiple metrics? If so, account for that in your analysis. A really common academic answer is the Bonferonni correction. I've never seen anyone use it in real life though, because it is too conservative. A more common way is to control the False Discovery Rate. You can google this. Alternatively, the book [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://amzn.to/4dzXyZP) by Ron Kohavi discusses how to do this (note: this is an affiliate link). \n",
      "   * Do any stakeholders need to be informed about the experiment? \n",
      "   * Are there any novelty effects or change aversion that could impact interpretation?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase 3:** **The experiment is over. Now what?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. After you “run” the A/B test, you now have some data. Consider what recommendations you can make from them. What insights can you derive to take actionable steps for the business? Speaking to this will earn you brownie points with the interviewer.\n",
      "   * For example, can you think of some useful ways to segment your experiment data to determine whether there were heterogeneous treatment effects?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common follow-up questions, or “gotchas”**\n",
      "\n",
      "These are common questions that interviewers will ask to see if you really understand A/B testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Let’s say that you are mid-way through running your A/B test and the performance starts to get worse. It had a strong start but now your success metric is degrading. Why do you think this could be?\n",
      "   * A common answer is novelty effect\n",
      "* Let’s say that your AB test is concluded and your chosen p-value cutoff is 0.05. However, your success metric has a p-value of 0.06. What do you do?\n",
      "   * Some options are: Extend the experiment. Run the experiment again.\n",
      "   * You can also say that you would discuss the risk of a false positive with your business stakeholders. It may be that the treatment doesn’t have much downside, so the company is OK with rolling out the feature, even if there is no true improvement. However, this is a discussion that needs to be had with all relevant stakeholders and as a data scientist or product analyst, you need to help quantify the risk of rolling out a false positive treatment.\n",
      "* Your success metric was stat sig positive, but one of your guardrail metrics was harmed. What do you do?\n",
      "   * Investigate the cause of the guardrail metric dropping. Once the cause is identified, work with the product manager or business stakeholders to update the treatment such that hopefully the guardrail will not be harmed, and run the experiment again.\n",
      "   * Alternatively, see if there is a segment of the population where the guardrail metric was not harmed. Release the treatment to only this population segment.\n",
      "* Your success metric ended up being stat sig negative. How would you diagnose this? \n",
      "\n",
      "I know this is really long but honestly, most of the steps I listed could be an entire blog post by itself. If you don't understand anything, I encourage you to do some more research about it, or get the book that I linked above (I've read it 3 times through myself). Lastly, don't feel like you need to be an A/B test expert to pass the interview. We hire folks who have no A/B testing experience but can demonstrate framework of designing AB tests such as the one I have just laid out. Good luck!\n",
