# Welcome to the Data Science Project repository.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of independent data science projects, each housed within its own Git branch.

The goal of this structure is to demonstrate a broad range of data analysis, modeling, and storytelling skills while keeping each project self-contained for clarity and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

Each project branch focuses on a distinct analytical domain or dataset.
Switch branches in the GitHub interface to explore the contents of each project.
          
          Branch                    Project Focus                              Description
          Real_Estate               Housing Market Analytics                   Examines real estate pricing dynamics, feature correlations, and regression modeling for predictive valuation.
          Chicago_Crime             Urban Crime Data Analysis                  Explores crime trends in Chicago, performing spatial-temporal analysis and building predictive insights using public datasets.
          St-Louis_Traffic          Transportation & Traffic Insights          Investigates traffic patterns in St. Louis, integrating weather, location, and time-based variables to model congestion behavior.
          Suicide                   Mental Health & Risk Prediction            Analyzes suicide statistics and potential socioeconomic or demographic correlates, employing machine learning for early-risk identification.

## How to Navigate the Repository

1. Click the Branch dropdown menu (top-left on the repository page).
2. Select the branch of the project you wish to view.
3. Each branch includes:
   - A primary Jupyter notebook with full analysis and narrative.
   - Supporting datasets or CSV files (if applicable).
   - Python scripts for data cleaning or modeling.
   - A project-specific README or documentation.

## Common Tools and Libraries

Each project leverages tools commonly used in data science and analytics, including:
   - Python 3.x
   - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
   - Scikit-learn, StatsModels
   - Jupyter Notebook for analysis and storytelling
   - Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Learning & Research Objectives

   - Across these projects, the emphasis is on:
   - Developing reproducible data analysis workflows.
   - Applying machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction.
   - Interpreting results in the context of public health, housing, and urban systems.
   - Communicating insights effectively through code and visualization.
