# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This repository contains a complete data science project focused on analyzing and predicting airline customer satisfaction.
The work combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to uncover the factors most strongly associated with passenger satisfaction in commercial air travel.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze customer feedback and operational metrics from airline services to:

 - Identify key drivers of passenger satisfaction.
 - Explore correlations between service attributes such as departure delay, arrival delay, and overall ratings.
 - Build a predictive model to classify customers as “satisfied” or “dissatisfied.”
 - Provide actionable recommendations for improving customer experience and loyalty.

## Analytical Highlights

 - Correlation Analysis:
             - Reveals a strong positive correlation between departure delay and arrival delay, confirming that late departures almost always result in late arrivals.

- Loyalty Insights:
          - Loyal customers consistently report higher satisfaction compared to non-loyal passengers, underlining the business value of retaining frequent flyers.

- Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering:
          - Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to uncover hidden patterns and clusters in customer responses, helping visualize key satisfaction drivers.

- Predictive Modeling:
          - Employs classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict satisfaction outcomes based on service attributes such as in-flight entertainment, seat comfort, and food quality.

## Key Findings

### Dining Experience:
  
          - Expanding high-quality food and beverage options significantly enhances satisfaction.

### Customer Service:

          - Increasing staff availability improves response time and attentiveness.

### Entertainment Variety:

          - Offering a wider range of in-flight entertainment options improves long-flight satisfaction.

### Seat Comfort:

          - Enhanced seating design and legroom substantially raise comfort scores.

These recommendations were derived from data-driven analysis and aim to increase overall satisfaction, loyalty, and positive brand perception
