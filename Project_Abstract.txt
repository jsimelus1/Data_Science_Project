This project is designed to analyze Missouri’s socioeconomic data, offering valuable insights for homebuyers. This analysis supports potential homebuyers, particularly those unfamiliar with Missouri. It provides an analysis that allows people to understand the differences between regions in the state by offering an objective view to explore neighborhoods that align with their financial and lifestyle preferences and needs. The study uses data from official sources, including the American Community Survey (ACS), to analyze factors such as race and ethnicity, housing, educational attainment, and income distributions. This case study evaluates key factors such as income distribution, educational attainment, racial and ethnic composition, and housing characteristics across Missouri neighborhoods. By prioritizing these categories, the study seeks to clarify how external attributes influence median home values and neighborhood appeal. I employ geospatial techniques and data visualization to assess neighborhood-level trends and differences. The project integrates statistical and machine learning models, including PCA, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), to analyze socioeconomic and housing factors. These models utilize predictors such as income, education, and housing characteristics. Through geospatial and statistical methods, I evaluate trends and relationships within and between communities. The analysis highlights the economic differences between urban and rural areas, the demographic makeup of neighborhoods, and the impact of education and housing variables on home values. This study establishes the groundwork for integrating additional factors such as proximity to amenities and personalized recommendations. By reducing uncertainty this project helps inform buyers when evaluating real estate opportunities.
